## Installation

This pack is designed to work with any standard resolutions but has only been tested fully on 1920x1080.

To use this pack you must have Auto Hot key (AHK) installed on your computer, If you do not have it installed you can download it from AutoHotkey.com

A instructional video on AHK is provided by Titchgamer here: https://youtu.be/9OulkTSZSp4

To install the Bezel pack please extract the pack to the root Snes9x directory.
You will then have a folder called “SindenBezels” and a AHK file for each game in your main Snes9x directory.

You need to have your roms stored in a Folder called “Roms” in the root directory.
If you do want them in a different location you will need to change the directory in the AHK file later.

There are options avalable for 4:3 and 8:7 aspect ratios in the SindenBezels directory.
Simply copy the bezels from the directory you want to the SindenBezels directory to change aspect ratio.
Don't forget to change it in Snes9X too.

Have fun!
